# Snapper

Snapchat is one of the mainstream app which embeds great UI and transitions along with the important features like:

  - Chatting
  - Sending Snap/Photo
  - Camera Integration
  - Map Integration
  - Social relations like having friends relationships which is fairly difficult to implement.

Here is my **Snapper**, It is completely made using *flutter* and *firebase*, which as much as less packages and includes the most of the snapchat features.
I also implemented serverless functions to include the functions like **notifications** and **counting streaks**.

Now without wasting you're time lets get started with the gifs of the projects so that you can have a brief Idea how this works.
